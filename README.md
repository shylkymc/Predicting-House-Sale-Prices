# Predicting-House-Sale-Prices
In this project, I predicted house sale prices. I used the data set from the city of Ames, Iowa, United States. And, the data set include data  from 2006 to 2010 years. 
I used linear regression modelling and I found RMSE value to test my model's performance. I used pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn, and seaborn libraries on my project.
