# Predicting-House-Sale-Prices
In this project, I predicted house sale prices. I used the data set from the city of Ames, Iowa, United States. The data set include data  from 2006 to 2010 years. I prepared the data with feture engineering and feature selection processes. In feature selection step, I calculated coefficients and made feature selection according to results.
I used linear regression modelling and I found RMSE values to test my model's performance with Scikit-learn library.
